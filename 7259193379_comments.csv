"10214870832948724","Tammy Gaede","Why is this man not removed immediately from office?  I encourage everyone to demand his ousting from office and no more Muslims to Obama's cabinet!  Muslim Congressman Spotted Getting Friendly with Terrorist Frontman Indiana Democratic Representative Andre Carson is one of two sitting U.S. Congressman who are also Muslim. He recently made an appearance at a major Islamic convention in Chicago. The gathering was sponsored by the Muslim American Society (MAS) and the Islamic Circle of North American. During the conference, Carson participated in a panel discussing recent events in Ferguson, Missouri. Another participant on the panel was Mazen Mokhtar, a man who is known to operate an Al Queda website and as a fundraiser for the Taliban. The Conservative Tribune reports: It is presumed that Carson knew who Mokhtar is, and it is certain that the FBI knows who Mokhtar is, as he was named in a 2004 federal investigation of a UK-based Al Qaeda website that raised money for the Taliban, among other terrorist organizations. Mokhtar stands accused of operating a US-based mirror website of the one in the UK, according to PJ Media. As per the Washington Post: “Mazen Mokhtar, an Egyptian-born imam and political activist, operated a Web [sic] site identified in an affidavit unsealed Friday by the U.S. attorney’s office in Connecticut. The Web site solicited funds for the Taliban and Chechen mujaheddin, according to the affidavit. It is an exact replica of Web [sic] sites operated by Babar Ahmad, who was arrested in England on a U.S. extradition warrant this week.” A CNN report further explained: “Law enforcement sources identified the man as Mazen Mokhtar, 36, of New Brunswick, New Jersey. Those sources said Mokhtar is the ‘specific individual who resides in the United States’ referred to in the affidavit as working with Babar Ahmad to solicit funds for the “blocked organizations … in an effort to support their goals.” Somewhat predictably, once Mokhtar was named in the affidavits, he was embraced even tighter and promoted by the Islamic community. Mokhtar currently serves as the executive director of the MAS (Muslim American Society), a group described by federal prosecutors in federal court in 2007 as “founded as the overt arm of the Muslim Brotherhood in the United States.” Members of Congress have been discussing a measure to name the Muslim Brotherhood an official terrorist organization. When that takes place, it will be interesting to see if Representative Carson continues to flaunt his connections with America’s enemies.","2015-01-15T17:58:36+0000",0,0,"10152700720003380_10152702099993380","7259193379_10152700720003380",FALSE,NA

A similar bill was in committee last year with over 250 co-sponsors and was not brought to the floor for a house vote. This is not a Democrat or Republican issue. The bill has had bi-partisan support and will continue to enjoy this support.  Between 1991 and February 2002 Vietnam veteran who served on land, inland waterways, or off the coast of Vietnam were not required to present any sort of documentation as evidence for actually dioxin exposure. In February 2002 the Department of Veterans Affairs changed their rules set forth in 1991 so that you needed to have “Boots on the Ground” in Vietnam or any of it’s offshore islands  In 2002 an Australian Study (EXAMINATION OF THE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE OF ROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY (RAN) PERSONNEL TO POLYCHLORINATED DIBENZODIOXINS AND POLYCHLORINATED DIBENZOFURANS VIA DRINKING WATER) found that the water distillation process would actually enhance the toxicity of any dioxin present in the original saltwater.

"904395119599132","Cliff Page","Boycott PM Bibi Netanyahu's speech to the Congress.  The United States should not be sending $3.5 Billion to Israel just to have Israel and hasbara Zionist sympathizers and American 5th columnist spent $20 Million in buying off the Congress.  Nor should our Congress be intimidated or coerced by such a minority group of individuals, particularly if they are foreign nationals.  It is against US law for American legislators to lobby and financially interfere in foreign affairs and it is repugnant that our Congress is owned and dictated to by Israel and their people routinely throw this contempt in our faces in their press.    Israel and its right wing government is about to pass a ""Jewish State Bill"" which will officially discriminate against anyone in Israel that is not Jewish and speaking Hebrew - Jews, Christians and Druze.  Israel operates as a democracy, but  one without a Bill of Rights.  It is obligated to numerous documents: The Balfour Declaration, the League of Nations Charter, the UN Charter and the Ben-Gurion Zionist Declaration, which required the State of Israel and the Jews living in Palestine to uphold the right and liberties of he indigenous peoples and it has not done so since 1947, but rather has used its stated policy of Plan D to carry out ethnic cleansing and apartheid since it was first employed by the Irgun in 1948.  Israel is a racist, theocratic and discriminatory state that practices state murder, penal torture, colonization, property theft, child incarceration, disproportionate warfare, usurpation and theft of natural resources. Israel and particular Netanyahu and his FM Lieberman have provoked anti-Semitism amongst the civilian populations of other nations, including our own, to its benefit and political ends.   Israel is not a friend of Great Britain nor the United States and has used terror against both our nations: The bombing of the King David Hotel 1948; the Lavon Affair 1954; the attack on the USS Liberty 1967.  It has also spied on the United States and stolen state secrets.  Israel is not our friend and it is obscene that our Congress is bought and owned by them.  This must end.    PM Netanyahu's speaking to the Congress about Iran is an effort on his part to strengthen his chances to win an election for his right wing Lakud party, to form an extremist reactionary and Fascist coalition; to deflect attention away from the revulsion of young, Orthodox and liberal Jews in America and Europeans opposed to Israel and its policies, who in general have all stood up in protest to the Israeli and Zionist slaughter in Gaza of nearly 2500 mostly innocent civilians and the destruction of billions of dollars in real-estate; and the fast growing support for Palestinian statehood and their acceptance as a member of the ICC; and their intention to bring war crimes against Netanyahu and the state of Israel.    It is time that America made a change in its misguided policies and reject Fascism and supports human rights.  Israel has no Bill of Rights and been the principal model for terrorism and counter terrorism in the Middle East from its birth.  It is a wolf cloaked in a sheep skin.  It is a slap in the face to our President and to his Secretary of State and shows great contempt for our people and our government.  A large population even in Israel see this visit of Netanyahu to speak to the Congress as contrary to their own interest and likewise are scared to death that the ""Jewish State Bill"" will pass if he is elected, which will guarantee tyranny in that state.  The United States needs to stop listening to the Zionist right wing propaganda and stand up for what we believe in and promote what we believe in the principles enumerated in our Bill of Rights!    As a combat veteran and someone who has traveled and worked in the Middle East since 1965 and knows the history and cultures of that region, I strongly urge you to boycott Netanyahu's speech and to urge your other legislators to likewise.  Certainly no member of the Congressional Black Caucus should attend a speech given by the leader of a state that supports racism, apartheid, segregation, discrimination and bigotry and uses racial and religious inflammatory rhetoric to subjugate others and maintain its power and status!","2015-02-08T16:43:45+0000",0,0,"10152712694983380_10152748668193380","7259193379_10152712694983380",FALSE,NA

He went around forgiving all sin, healing all sickness, even raising the dead!! The blind received sight, the deaf heard, the lame walked, those with leprosy were cleansed, & he preached good news to the poor!! He drove out demons, fed thousands, & performed many other miracles, signs & wonders!! He discipled His followers to do likewise & even greater works than He, in love for Him & His commandments, especially to “Love each other as I have loved you” & “Greater love has no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.” Then as the Law & Prophets testified, he was condemned to suffer crucifixion to pay the death penalty for our sins on the cross!! After his burial, three days later, God raised Him to life forever as Lord & Savior over all creation!! He then ascended into heaven to sit at the right hand of God promising everlasting life in His kingdom to all who believe in Jesus’ name to be saved from death & hell!! Soon, Jesus will come back from heaven to earth, in the clouds, & will judge the living & the dead for every word & deed!! Believe, be baptized & repent!!

"10213572727449198","Gayle Ferguson","Important to attend PM Netanyahu’s address to Congress: Supposedly, the deal Obama is negotiating with Iran will allow them to keep between 5K and 6.5K centrifuges used to enrich uranium. The original 2006 UN resolution said Iran had to eliminate all of its centrifuges. After the latest 5+1 negotiations began, the word was Iran would be allowed to keep a token number of centrifuges to save face. The Obama administration is looking to bring Iran down to a level where the President can look like a hero because he cut Iranian centrifuges back by 75%. Not being discussed by the President, the Democrats, or the mainstream media is the fact that even at the higher number of centrifuges (6.5k) Iran would not have the capacity to produce enough uranium to run power plants - BUT, will have the capacity to make NUCLEAR BOMBS! ! ! ! !. This won’t only affect Israel but the rest of us too. Netanyahu has been accused of only being interested in his political survival and afraid to launch an attack on Iran to slow or end its nuclear armament program. In an effort to comply with U.S. demands, Netanyahu has put himself at political risk at home. It is, of course, the Obama administration that has led the most servile negotiations to date with Iran, granting all manner of concessions in order to get an agreement that would put that terror-sponsoring nation within 3 or 4 months of having a nuclear warhead for its missiles or bomb for its aircraft. Netanyahu -- “I am under attack simply because I am defending the State of Israel. If I didn’t stand firm on our national interests, I would not be under attack.”  The six years of Obama’s terms in office have been a succession of insults and demands that would make Israel vulnerable to the constant presence of its enemies, Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, two terror organizations that are proxies for their sponsor, Iran. During the recent military operations to end months of continued rocketing from Gaza, the U.S. repeatedly called on Israel to stop. When it was over, countless tunnels whose sole purpose was for Palestinian terrorists to attack Israelis were found. Tunnels have also been a problem for Egypt and they are the ones that run from the Sinai area into Gaza. Following the Camp David Accords in 1979, Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty. Until then no Middle East Arab nation had any intention of acknowledging Israel’s sovereignty. The treaty has held firm since then, but the new Egyptian leadership came to power after the people demanded that the Muslim Brotherhood be removed from office. It was; first by military coup and then by an election. It is the same Muslim Brotherhood some of whose members have been part of the Obama administration. So, Egypt ranks high among Israel’s allies in very real ways. The same can be said of Saudi Arabia, the Muslim holy land where Mecca and Medina are located. As Bret Stephens, a Wall Street Journal columnist, noted in late October, “The real problem for the administration is that the Israelis—along with all the other disappointed allies—are learning how little it pays to be on Barack Obama’s good side.” “Since coming to office in 2009,” noted Stephens, “Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has agreed, against his own inclination and over the objections of his political bases, to (1) recognize the Palestinian state, (2) enforce an unprecedented 10-month settlement freeze, (3) release scores of Palestinian prisoners held on murder charges, (4) embark on an ill-starred effort to reach a final peace deal with the Palestinians, (5) refrain from taking overt military steps against Iran, and (6) agree to every possible cease-fire during the summer’s war with Hamas.” That, however, has not been enough for the Obama administration. Not only did it hold up “the delivery of munitions at the height of the Gaza war”, but Secretary of State John Kerry blamed Israel for the failure to achieve peace with the Palestinians when history confirms their long resistance and refusal to any peace deal. Kerry even managed to attribute the rise of the Islamic State to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That is delusional and deeply offensive. Largely unreported because the two nations want it that way, Saudi Arabia and Israel have long been in discussions of what to do if the U.S. sells out both of them by concluding a deal with Iran regarding its nuclear arms program. Such a deal would leave both nations and all others in the Middle East and beyond vulnerable to Iran.","2015-03-02T19:10:36+0000",0,0,"10152783422333380_10152793448438380","7259193379_10152783422333380",TRUE,"10152783422333380_10152788603858380"

"10213572727449198","Gayle Ferguson","Important to attend PM Netanyahu’s address to Congress: Supposedly, the deal Obama is negotiating with Iran will allow them to keep between 5K and 6.5K centrifuges used to enrich uranium. The original 2006 UN resolution said Iran had to eliminate all of its centrifuges. After the latest 5+1 negotiations began, the word was Iran would be allowed to keep a token number of centrifuges to save face. The Obama administration is looking to bring Iran down to a level where the President can look like a hero because he cut Iranian centrifuges back by 75%. Not being discussed by the President, the Democrats, or the mainstream media is the fact that even at the higher number of centrifuges (6.5k) Iran would not have the capacity to produce enough uranium to run power plants - BUT, will have the capacity to make NUCLEAR BOMBS! ! ! ! !. This won’t only affect Israel but the rest of us too. Netanyahu has been accused of only being interested in his political survival and afraid to launch an attack on Iran to slow or end its nuclear armament program. In an effort to comply with U.S. demands, Netanyahu has put himself at political risk at home. It is, of course, the Obama administration that has led the most servile negotiations to date with Iran, granting all manner of concessions in order to get an agreement that would put that terror-sponsoring nation within 3 or 4 months of having a nuclear warhead for its missiles or bomb for its aircraft. Netanyahu -- “I am under attack simply because I am defending the State of Israel. If I didn’t stand firm on our national interests, I would not be under attack.”  The six years of Obama’s terms in office have been a succession of insults and demands that would make Israel vulnerable to the constant presence of its enemies, Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, two terror organizations that are proxies for their sponsor, Iran. During the recent military operations to end months of continued rocketing from Gaza, the U.S. repeatedly called on Israel to stop. When it was over, countless tunnels whose sole purpose was for Palestinian terrorists to attack Israelis were found. Tunnels have also been a problem for Egypt and they are the ones that run from the Sinai area into Gaza. Following the Camp David Accords in 1979, Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty. Until then no Middle East Arab nation had any intention of acknowledging Israel’s sovereignty. The treaty has held firm since then, but the new Egyptian leadership came to power after the people demanded that the Muslim Brotherhood be removed from office. It was; first by military coup and then by an election. It is the same Muslim Brotherhood some of whose members have been part of the Obama administration. So, Egypt ranks high among Israel’s allies in very real ways. The same can be said of Saudi Arabia, the Muslim holy land where Mecca and Medina are located. As Bret Stephens, a Wall Street Journal columnist, noted in late October, “The real problem for the administration is that the Israelis—along with all the other disappointed allies—are learning how little it pays to be on Barack Obama’s good side.” “Since coming to office in 2009,” noted Stephens, “Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has agreed, against his own inclination and over the objections of his political bases, to (1) recognize the Palestinian state, (2) enforce an unprecedented 10-month settlement freeze, (3) release scores of Palestinian prisoners held on murder charges, (4) embark on an ill-starred effort to reach a final peace deal with the Palestinians, (5) refrain from taking overt military steps against Iran, and (6) agree to every possible cease-fire during the summer’s war with Hamas.” That, however, has not been enough for the Obama administration. Not only did it hold up “the delivery of munitions at the height of the Gaza war”, but Secretary of State John Kerry blamed Israel for the failure to achieve peace with the Palestinians when history confirms their long resistance and refusal to any peace deal. Kerry even managed to attribute the rise of the Islamic State to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That is delusional and deeply offensive. Largely unreported because the two nations want it that way, Saudi Arabia and Israel have long been in discussions of what to do if the U.S. sells out both of them by concluding a deal with Iran regarding its nuclear arms program. Such a deal would leave both nations and all others in the Middle East and beyond vulnerable to Iran.","2015-03-02T19:09:08+0000",2,0,"10152786028808380_10152793446423380","7259193379_10152786028808380",FALSE,NA

"810899392446496","Mitch Protheroe","Final draft of my essay on identity and my psychedelic use    Whatever It Takes  People are often encouraged to make decisions based on vague information that is designed to sound enticing and harmless. These decisions aren’t always fueled by business advertisements; sometimes it’s a friend who heard about something that sounds interesting and wants you to try it, and you bite. There are plenty of examples of things like that, but one thing that came into my life through listening to a friend’s suggestion was hallucinogenic drugs. These plants and molecules resulted in various surreal experiences that at first I didn’t know how to rationalize, but over time I realized there was a lot I learned from those experiments. While the choices I made to try hallucinogens were relatively extreme and potentially hazardous, they may have had the most important impact on my life, expanding my previously limited concept of identity and life as a whole.  With all the factors and stakes at hand, it is so important to figure out what life means to you as early as possible, and I certainly gave myself a decent head-start, albeit unintentionally. Using psychoactive drugs wasn’t a decision I made particularly because of these decisions, but rather because of curiosity. The psychedelic experience can take time to undergo and digest internally, but so can any experience. The main feeling I got from hallucinogens was a sense of who I really was- pure, uninfluenced by anything I had been conditioned to growing up- and how important it is that I take the outcome of my life seriously. I was very shocked to discover how open ended life can be, and how much potential there is to be happy in my own way. Sure, some of the trips were complex, geometric visuals, and it alerted me to how interesting the creative mind can possibly be, but as an artist here and there, I already sort of got the picture that imagination is boundless in this realm. What really struck me the most under the influence of these drugs was the feeling of power and independence I was shown. I think it was critical that I discovered this early in my adult life. It can take years and years for some people to figure out who they want to be, or even the meaning of it all. There are so many decisions to make, and without a clear head for exactly what you want, this can take a person in many different directions, which is why I’m glad I was able to have a better glimpse about who I was and what I have been going through while I was still fairly young. Decisions are important throughout life, but when you’re young you have the most time, and a decent amount of flexibility for your future. That being said, it is also a time when ignorance and carelessness can be most common.  One of the worst things to be in life is oblivious. A perspective I gained from using hallucinogens was the fact that while lots of different things have happened throughout my life, I had taken very little from all of it, perhaps because my upbringing and my surroundings projected a sort of “safe haven” effect, where my existence felt isolated from all the bad things, even if they are nearby and/or present, so my opinion seemed inconsequential through it all. That view of separation and impotency caused me to act in ways that were more typical in society rather than truly necessary and wise. If only I had realized how everything was playing out when I was younger, then I would have started writing music at a younger age, for example, and expressed myself more clearly and concisely as I feel I do today. My relationships with people would have been much different- I would’ve been able to accept spending more time alone in order to work on projects, and I would be able to talk act on some of the deeper and more relevant issues of life rather than be absorbed in the culture the way I was, which was distracting and obfuscating my attention. I think the risk I took by trying psychedelics empowered me to be constructive, because they aided my ability to take in and fathom what is really happening; the reality of everything and where I come into play.  While I should have striven throughout my life to make a helpful impact, I made some invaluable realizations through experimenting with my consciousness that really have made me a more insightful, critical, and happy person. Part of that change, for example, is thinking more positively, and realizing the true potential of life and its opportunities. I like to think that with just one person with good intent and outlook, the entire world can be changed positively; just that one person being able to take something they learned and applying it to their life and their endeavors can have a crucial impact on everything. The greater the amount of people that can be exposed to constructive insights and ideas, the greater there is a chance that human beings will maximize positive change to the world, so even if I don’t know that using psychedelic substances has such a profound impact on everyone as it has I, I’m sure it must provide a better awareness of life to some of its users, and the ideas that it produces can be exchanged regardless of whether everyone wants to try these substances. The way I see it, there is bound to be a result of more mindful and practical people through this process. Just one person being able to take something they learned and applying it to their life and their endeavors can have a crucial impact on everything, and with as many problems as there are in the world, the more people who seek to solve them, and practice sensibility, the better; some just lack a sense of urgency and motivation because they were raised to simply cope with misfortune, accept some level of defeat, and smile through the pain, worry, and struggle of everyday living that we sometimes face, even in America. However, there is potential for change for everyone alive to make an impact somehow, and perhaps hallucinogens, often labeled as recreational, dangerous, or fruitless, help generate the insights people need to get them started and inspired as I feel they have done for me. Ultimately, whatever happens to people in life, whether they decide to use these drugs or not, it’s about what they learn, not just simply what transpires, and hopefully when more people realize this and see their true potential, that can translate into good decisions and discoveries, rather than mishaps and less-than-desirable events and life stories.   Although I underwent some of these said mystical experiences early in my adult life, I still made poor choices afterwards by failing to reflect and understand what they really meant. Granted, I hadn’t tried the drug that I feel had the most impact on me- DMT- quite yet, before some of the worst things happened to me, including over two weeks spent in prison. Nonetheless, I still had plenty of knowledge and experience before I got myself into trouble, and should have been more cautious and smart with my decisions. I feel that although I was fortunate to be able to experiment with drugs, my environment was not conductive to me figuring out what the trips were trying to tell me. A lot of the culture I’m surrounded by is still relatively misleading and perplexing in my opinion, so it actually took me very long to process the important elements of everything I had been shown. Many people who have tried the most powerful hallucinogenic drugs, as I have, say that they forget most of what happened, and for a while, I could say the same. Only a month ago, I still didn’t know what to make of my life, and I haven’t taken these drugs in well over a year. Unfortunately, I have to face consequences still today from choices I made when I was still trying to conform and follow the notions I was taught rather than my true feelings. On the bright side, I finally don’t feel internally contrasted like I used to, and I believe this is because I finally digested what everything in life has been trying to tell me, and how I really feel. Psychedelics gave me experiences that somewhat recently left a meaningful impression on me and I just needed time to think about it to comprehend the implications. It’s too bad that I didn’t understand right off the bat so I wouldn’t have to deal with unnecessary issues, but “such is life”. At least now I feel like I get it. I believe hallucinogens can increase the capacity to think critically and “see the whole picture”, which gets people closer to being on a positive path; at least, that is what happened to me. No doubt, my grasp on life has been augmented by the wisdom gained by my psychedelic experiences, to which I am grateful and lucky. I discerned through comprehending the nature of my consciousness that whether there is a god or not, I know much of existence is directly in our hands. I believe love, peace, and respect can truly reign as I would want them to, and my confidence of this can certainly be accredited to my use of all natural hallucinogens. There is a sense of responsibility that comes with realizing that you want what is best for the world, and you have the power to help, but it is no more of a burden than pretending or believing that there is nothing you can do and that you are the only one that matters. It’s without hesitation that I say: psychedelic drugs strongly contributed to positive changes in my life. Although I wish I could have felt this way sooner, and without taking the risk of me doing harmful things during or after my trips, it’s better late than never, and the knowledge I gained definitely provides me profound harm-reduction anyway. While the ordeals I had under the influence were by no means entirely comfortable or risk-less, I attest that they may have had the most positive influence on my thinking, and subsequently, the choices I make every day. I’m glad I decided to endure experimentation with these substances so that I may shed light on the turmoil of today, by reflecting on the past, being wary of the unresolved tension of the present, and working to forge myself and others a better future.","2015-09-02T00:26:17+0000",0,0,"10152786028808380_10153195061663380","7259193379_10152786028808380",FALSE,NA

NA,NA,"Meanwhile you missed a terribly terribly important speech.  Protect our security by listening to Netanyahu. It was disgraceful for any American leader to turn their back.   An excerpt from Netanyahu's speech:     ""I don't believe that Iran's radical regime will change for the better after this deal. This regime has been in power for 36 years, and its voracious appetite for aggression grows with each passing year. This deal would wet appetite -- would only wet Iran's appetite for more. Would Iran be less aggressive when sanctions are removed and its economy is stronger? If Iran is gobbling up four countries right now while it's under sanctions, how many more countries will Iran devour when sanctions are lifted? Would Iran fund less terrorism when it has mountains of cash with which to fund more terrorism? Why should Iran's radical regime change for the better when it can enjoy the best of both world's: aggression abroad, prosperity at home? This is a question that everyone asks in our region. Israel's neighbors -- Iran's neighbors know that Iran will become even more aggressive and sponsor even more terrorism when its economy is unshackled and it's been given a clear path to the bomb. And many of these neighbors say they'll respond by racing to get nuclear weapons of their own. So this deal won't change Iran for the better; it will only change the Middle East for the worse. A deal that's supposed to prevent nuclear proliferation would instead spark a nuclear arms race in the most dangerous part of the planet. This deal won't be a farewell to arms. It would be a farewell to arms control. And the Middle East would soon be crisscrossed by nuclear tripwires. A region where small skirmishes can trigger big wars would turn into a nuclear tinderbox. If anyone thinks -- if anyone thinks this deal kicks the can down the road, think again. When we get down that road, we'll face a much more dangerous Iran, a Middle East littered with nuclear bombs and a countdown to a potential nuclear nightmare. Ladies and gentlemen, I've come here today to tell you we don't have to bet the security of the world on the hope that Iran will change for the better. We don't have to gamble with our future and with our children's future. We can insist that restrictions on Iran's nuclear program not be lifted for as long as Iran continues its aggression in the region and in the world. Before lifting those restrictions, the world should demand that Iran do three things. First, stop its aggression against its neighbors in the Middle East. Second, stop supporting terrorism around the world. And third, stop threatening to annihilate my country, Israel, the one and only Jewish state. Thank you. If the world powers are not prepared to insist that Iran change its behavior before a deal is signed, at the very least they should insist that Iran change its behavior before a deal expires. If Iran changes its behavior, the restrictions would be lifted. If Iran doesn't change its behavior, the restrictions should not be lifted. If Iran wants to be treated like a normal country, let it act like a normal country.""","2015-03-05T11:00:54+0000",0,0,"10152795365748380_10152798595178380","7259193379_10152795365748380",FALSE,NA

Hank Johnson continue to play silly political games, while not providing leadership to stop the senseless murder of unarmed Black Men in America. Standing on the House of Representative Floor reading the names of those murdered by law enforcement officers was an insult to them and their families.   Here's what he and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus should do, if they had the moral courage to stand up for their people. They should demand that President Obama Sign an ""Executive Order"" cutting federal funding to any Law Enforcement Agency found guilty of violating the civil and human rights of Black African Americans at the city, county, state and federal levels. That means that that law enforcement would receive NO Federal Money! This would cause an immediate end of all racial profiling, prosecutorial misconduct and mass incarceration of Black African Americans.   But I don't think that President Obama would use that power to protect Black African Americans, nor do I think that we have any Conscious and Caring Elected Black African American or Appointed Officials with the moral courage to demand that the President protect Black men, women and children from racist policies, racist law enforcement officers and racist state politicians.

I've had 5 separate personal encounters with poorly run nursing facilities n I'm struggling to care for my mom at home. If she has the care then we're suffering for supplies for wound care Etc. In the nursing homes you're told one thing at admissions n the reality is horrific!!!! I'm surprised some people can sleep at night. More funding goes into the facility than what follows a person home!!! This must stop.  My care is FREE to my lived one BUT I shouldn't have to struggle n fight for supplies n other means of support. TOO much funding is going towards Monsters in Medical facilities n we need to address these problems now. NO not everyone fits this despicable description but for every good person u have 6 bad ones who has no business handing the elderly or anyone who's in a vulnerable situation. When I removed my mom from a nursing home it was bitter sweet because I wished I could have taken every single resident home with me. PLEASE forge an awareness against negligent treatment in nursing homes or care facilities. Then provide more programs that will allow the same funding to follow a person to the house that was being sent to the facility. The elderly needs more options to remain comfortable n in familiar surroundings. Thank you for every consideration you give this suggestion.

ERIC HOLDER appointed CHARLES SAMUELS as BOP director, who is now retiring amid accusations that he has used solitary confinement as a method of illegal torture of prisoners.  How convenient.  Sir, as you read this, Kent Hovind is shivering, and freezing to death in Yazoo City USP, on purpose, and not one person in elected authority will say a word about it, or come to his aid.  We have been forced to contact the FBI and report this as an attempted murder in progress, and STILL we get the run around from elected officials.  One phone call from you could end this insane situation Mr Thompson.  Will you be the one to save Kent Hovind's life?

NA,NA,"What We Blacks Need To Do  Summer Educational Plans for Students and Parents  PROBLEMS: 1.	Many students never open a book during the summer. 2.	They sleep until around 1:00 pm and only get up to raid the refrigerator when their stomachs start to growl from hunger pains. 3.	They hang out in the mall, a friend’s house and a few on corners or other places that the parents are not aware of. 4.	The majority of their time is spent talking/texting on the phone, listening to music using social media/playing computer games and watching television. 5.	The parents failed to assign them chores or plan their summer educational activities.  SOLUTIONS:  To help your child succeed, all parents, guardians and concerned relatives must write out a plan for the students under their care for the summer.  It will be easier to carry out if the student is willing, and help write it but if they are not, you must do it anyway. You must step up and be loving, but firm. If you do not put your foot down, who will?   NOTE: My wife and I developed this plan for our newborn son. It helped make him the successful and enthusiastic social studies teacher he is today. This is his sixth year and he loves his job. It will work for your children and grandchildren!!!  You must keep a good supply of quality reading material in your home. The only cost to your family will be around $40 a year for a subscription to your local Black newspaper. All of the other necessary reading materials can be checked out free from your local library.  Newborn up to Kindergarten: Read to your children sometime during each day and at bedtime. Teach them by using pictures, letters, numbers, words, sounds, shapes, colors and everything they see during the course of a day. Never forget, you are their first and most important teacher. This is the formative time in their life and they think you are the smartest person in the world.  Use this time to teach them that learning is fun. Use the 75 /25 rule. Spend 75% of their time reading, writing, coloring, drawing and singing. The other 25% can be used on games, free playing and a little television viewing.                                                                                                   Elementary to Middle School: Most public libraries offer a summer reading program for children. Have them pick five or more books from the recommended reading list to prepare them for their next grade level. Encourage first, then demand if necessary they read something every day.   High School:  Do not allow your children to have any grade below a C+ unless they have a learning problem. Do not allow the school system psychologist to place your  child in special education class until you receive direct proof of a problem. It is a fact that Black students are far too often placed based on attitude rather than aptitude. Hire a reputable educational specialist not connected with your school system to test your child.   First ask your church, outreach organizations and family members for help. If they refuse, then borrow the money from a loan company if that is your last result. It is that important because this placement will help determine your children and grandchildren future.    Guide the precious gifts GOD gave you, your beautiful children, through two hours each day of reading something educational, writing summaries and meditating. Teach them how to analyze their problems and research the solutions. Strengthen your family unit by having frequent family discussions.                                     Parents as their leader must also abide by the two hour shut down rule. Read something that will help you reach the next step in your occupation, prepare for another career and become a better educated voter. The election year of 2016 is just around the corner.

"1802573496441977","Lisa Lane-Jones","My husband just spent 18 months in jail in Oxford because he blew the whistle on a couple of ""good ole boys"" who were illegally dumping asbestos in a black neighborhood. When the ""town"" said we couldn't talk about it at a town meeting we started a website. King good ole boy sheriff east said that if we didn't take the website down they would arrest is. We refused. They arrested my husband for a crime that never even I cured. Kept him in isolation for more than nine months,not even allowing him out to shower or exercise.  For nine months he bathed in a sink and never saw the sun. They beat him on two occasions trying to force him to plead guilty to a crime that not only he didn't commit, but a crime that never even occurred. Then the judge (Holworth) said that if he didn't plead guilty he would put him in a mental hospital and even issued a order to send him to Whitfield. I contacted Whitfield's legal staff and the wanted no part of Oxfords shenanigans. After 18 months they let him go but warned him if he ever speaks about this illegal dump, they'll come back for him. As it is he is ""banned"" from entering Lafayette county. It'll you all this to say freedom of speech is Amendment #1. Not the 5th or the last but number 1. Who was it that said, "" I do not agree with what you have to say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it.""?

Harris, a black Mississippi legislator, spoke on a bill to erect a Confederate Monument. He said the following:  ""Mr. Speaker, I have arisen here in my place to offer a few words on the bill. I have come from a sick bed. Perhaps it was not prudent for me to come, but Sir I could not rest quietly in my room without contributing a few remarks of my own. I was sorry to hear the speech of the young gentlemen from Marshall County. I am sorry that any son of a soldier should go on record as opposed to the erection of a monument in honor of their brave dead. And Sir, I am convinced that had he seen what I saw at Seven Pines and in the seven days fighting around Richmond, the battle field covered with the mangled forms of those who fought for their country and for their country's honor, he would not have made that speech. When the news came that the South had been invaded, those men went forth to fight for what they believed. And they made no requests for monuments. But they died and their virtues should be remembered. Sir, I went with them. I too wore the Grey. The same color my master wore. We stayed four long years and if that war had gone on until now, I would have been there yet. I want to honor those brave men who died for their convictions. When my mother died I was a boy. Who Sir, then acted the part of a mother to the orphaned slave boy but my old missus. Was she living now or could speak to me from those high realms where gathered the sainted dead, she would tell me to vote for this bill and, Sir, I shall vote for it. I want it known to all the world that my vote is given in favor of a bill to erect a monument in honor of the Confederate dead.""

Below is an excerpt that was taken from the ""Corner Stone "" Speech that was given by Alexander Stephens.    Please read below:  “Corner Stone” Speech  Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens Savannah, Georgia  March 21, 1861  ""One of the most striking characteristics of insanity, in many instances, is forming correct conclusions from fancied or erroneous premises; so with the anti-slavery fanatics. Their conclusions are right if their premises were. They assume that the negro is equal, and hence conclude that he is entitled to equal privileges and rights with the white man.""  Additionally I have attached a quote from William T. Thompson, The creator of the Confederate Flag, who believed he was fighting for Heaven Ordained Supremacy over people of color.  Surely you are an educated man and after being faced with the true history of this flag I am sure you now feel differently?   or NAH?","2015-06-25T15:21:02+0000",2,0,"10153045251178380_10153048938533380","7259193379_10153045251178380",FALSE,NA

""After the war ended, the symbol became a source of Souvthern pride and heritage, as well as a remembrance of Confederate soldiers who died in battle. But as racism and segregation gripped the nation in the century following, it became a divisive and violent emblem of the Ku Klux Klan and white supremacist groups. It was also the symbol of the States' Rights Democratic Party, or ""Dixiecrats,"" that formed in 1948 to oppose civil-rights platforms of the Democratic Party. Then-South Carolina Gov. Strom Thurmond was the splinter group's nominee for president that same year; he won 39 electoral votes.  Now, the flag is a frequent emblem of modern white supremacist groups.""

"815800045289764","Mitch Protheroe","“Whatever It Takes”  People are encouraged to make decisions based on vague information that is designed to sound enticing and harmless. These decisions aren’t always fueled by business advertisements; sometimes it’s a friend who heard about something that sounds interesting and wants you to try it, and you bite. There are plenty of examples of things like that, but one thing that came into my life through listening to a friend’s suggestion was hallucinogenic drugs. They resulted in various surreal experiences that at first I didn’t know how to rationalize, but over time I realized there was a lot I learned from those experiments. Something they helped me separate from temporarily was my casual attitude about life and the go-with-the-flow approach I was holding onto. Without being attached to indifferent mindsets, it is much easier to live a go-getter life, something which can make all the difference. While the choices I made to try hallucinogens were extreme and hazardous, they may have had the most important impact on my life. While the experiences I had were by no means comfortable, they may have had the most positive influence on my thinking. Just one person being able to take something they learned and applying it to their life and their endeavors can have a crucial impact on everything. While I’m disappointed with myself that it has taken me so much time and risk to draw the conclusions I have about life today, if it takes something serious to make a better, more logical understanding arise, that is okay because life should be taken very seriously. I believe that starting with just one person with good intent and outlook, the entire world can be changed positively, and that person could be me. While I should have strived all along to make a helpful impact, I made some invaluable realizations through experimenting with my consciousness that really have made me a more insightful and critical person who is willing to open up to people, and perhaps encourage them to consider trying these substances if they cannot grasp what I try to express. Even though one person does have influence in the world, there is always the additional potential of two people who have the same constructive vision, and like I said, sometimes the discomfort is worth the message. Through bravery and curiosity, I was given some of nature’s privileged information about existence, and I feel compelled to apply and share it. Ultimately, life is about what you make of it, and there are opportunities in this day and age for me to use my enlightenment for the better, so I try to encourage people who are more absorbed in the experiences rather than the lessons to try to relate something tangible to the world. I think the greater the amount of people that can be exposed to these constructive insights and ideas, the greater there is a chance that a group of game changers will bring many positive changes to the world. It may only take one person to see what psychedelics do for their mind and their understanding, a bold choice, to have the most important considerations of all, but I suppose some level of curiosity is universal, and through investigation, it is bound to influence another infinitely positively as it has influenced me.","2015-09-02T00:26:23+0000",0,0,"10153047548008380_10153195061808380","7259193379_10153047548008380",FALSE,NA

"10211879648328328","Chris Nesbitt","I am white. I was raised referring to this flag as the rebel flag. My parents, or anyone for that matter, never taught me that it stands for slavery or hatred. I view this as a symbol of being a rebel. Rebels are the most important thing in the world. How far would we ever progress as a society if we were all the same and thought the same thoughts? Sounds like a very mundane world full of complacency. Currently, we have our first black president. Is Obama not a rebel for stepping up and attempting to become president? Was he not going against the norm? Martin Luther King Jr. wasn't afraid to stand up and speak his mind against all the persecution that he faced for his beliefs. Guess what? He too is a rebel. Everyone thought Christopher Columbus was crazy setting sail into the great unknown, but that worked out for us didn't it? He too is a rebel. Rebels progress our society, because they aren't afraid to go against the normal grains of what society says is possible, even when they are told that what they are doing is pointless and stupid. To me, this flag stands for our right to go against all odds to blaze new trails that were never before seen as being possible. Is that not what is happening now? People who are calling for removing this flag are also rebels. By removing this flag, you are also removing a symbol of yourselves. Being a rebel is standing up and speaking your mind even when no one will stand with you. Rebels make this world a great and interesting place to live, because I don't want to live in a world where everyone is the same. It's our petty differences that set us apart and make the only race that truly matters, the HUMAN RACE, as great, as rare, and as special as it is. Just know that most white people don't see this as a symbol of hate. Of course, some people do, but many other cultures also view the Christian Bible in a similar fashion. There are always idiots, of any race, that are going make fools of themselves. This doesn't mean there are bad races. It simply means that there are bad people. It's a shame that something that I have always viewed as being a symbol of being a rebel, something that all races have, has been perverted in people's minds because of a handfuls of idiots. Regardless of your stance on this issue, you are a rebel for voicing your opinion! This flag, to me, encapsulates all of us: All of the people that have dared to dream and all of the people who have dared to chase tirelessly after the American Dream, and against all odds make the world a better place.

No he/she has sold it nor the gun is lost or stolen.  Paperwork to be signed by the owner of the gun being sold to a law abiding citizen with their signature as well.

"961513827307249","Larry M. Bradley","Thanks for asking.  You are correct in stating that the U. S. is not a theocracy. We are a Constitutional Republic. The government is of the people, by the people, and for the people. The Federal government exists by the will of the people and is limited in scope by the people. The Congress is made up of members  elected by the people. That is also true of the Administrative branch. The Judicial branch is an exception. The Supreme Court Judges are appointed. This was designed by the founders so they would not be swayed by political pressure or special interest groups. The Judges are supposed to be bound by  constitutionalism and originality. That is, they are supposed to determine what the Constitution means by determining the plain meaning of the wording as understood by those who originated the document. They are not supposed to write the laws, just interpret them. It was not the intention of the the  authors of any article of or any amendment to the Constitution that the definition of marriage, as ordained by God, be changed. All mankind, even unbelievers, are subject to the laws of God whether we agree with them or not. That includes governments. We will all be judged according to God's revealed will and commandments. That is where I and all citizens of The United States of America are drawn in to this equation. Nations as well as individuals will be judged. As a citizen of the U. S., I stand in jeopardy if I do not accept the laws of the land. I also stand in jeopardy if I violate the laws of God.  What ever the government can do to me will be temporary. On the other hand that which God can put upon me is permanent.  I will therefore obey God rather than man. ….... And He answered and said, ""Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE, and said, 'FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND BE JOINED TO HIS WIFE, AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH'? ""So they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.""  (Mat 19:4-6 NASB) When the righteous increase, the people rejoice, But when a wicked man rules, people groan.  (Pro 29:2 NASB) By the blessing of the upright a city is exalted, But by the mouth of the wicked it is torn down.  (Pro 11:11 NASB) But He said, ""On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God and observe it.""

Acclaimed Civil War historian James McPherson, in his 1997 book For Cause and Comrades: Why Men Fought in the Civil War, consulted a sizable quantity of primary sources, including soldiers’ diaries and their letters to loved ones, to try to determine how the ordinary soldier on each side thought of the war.  In two-thirds of his sources—the same proportion among Northern and Southern fighting men—soldiers said it was due to patriotism. Northern soldiers by and large said they were fighting to preserve what their ancestors had bequeathed to them: the Union.   Southern soldiers also referred to their ancestors, but they typically argued that the real legacy of the Founding Fathers was not so much the Union as the principle of self-government. Very often we see Southern soldiers comparing the South’s struggle against the U.S. government to the colonies’ struggle against Britain. Both, in their view, were wars of secession fought in order to preserve self-government.""","2015-07-09T19:50:21+0000",0,0,"10153077749378380_10153079400593380","7259193379_10153077749378380",FALSE,NA

"968678084338","Cane Cañé West","So... The first Africans bought as slaves by British people in North America were in 1619 on a slave ship in Jamestown, so your statement is patently false. (You're referring to Anthony Johnson, I presume) I totally agree that we should acknowledge the truth about Europeans building on a west african slave network. I don't believe there are clear moral stances by race, which is what omission of that fact suggests. What we do see is a vast escalation of the slave trade to meet european interests and then the gradual change at a fundamental level of African descended people being considered slaves simply by DNA. Having hereditary slavery based on skin color was a pretty big change. Then, it's awkward to have many of your biblical passages because, until the late 1700s, Christianity and Whiteness grew from the notion that Africans were lesser and incapable of Christ. So...Jesus might not have been White, but the notion of his as european and Christian was certainly solidified in the enslavement of black Africans. All this means two things. 1) there is much evidence to suggest that slavery in North and South America by Europeans became uniquely different than in many other places, on a scale never before seen. So ""Christians"" did care what color your skin was because they would later validate enslavement via the curse of Ham 2) you need to go read some more history.","2015-07-10T02:09:07+0000",0,0,"10153079303343380_10153079928733380","7259193379_10153079303343380",TRUE,"10153079303343380_10153079341698380"

In counties where there are (3) school districts like: Coahoma Agricultural High School, Clarksdale Municipal School Distirct and Coahoma County School District it is likely that (these small districts with small student populations will have (1) School District.  Senator Gray Tollison of Oxford, Ms is also asking to have all Mississippi School Superintendents appointed and all school boards elected.  Many districts do not wish to merge in fear of losing their character, cultural differences with its teachers, bands, football and basketball players and its total program.  State  of Mississippi Legislatures both Senators and Representatives are in hopes of solving its funding issues and problems along with State of Mississippi's State Superintendent of Education.  We don't want any schools to close, merge and consolidation but its seems to be the wave of the future with the declining student population and tax base from businesses , and real , personal , homestead exemption , trailer, car tags-motor vehicles and the decline in Casino Revenue and Donations in Mississippi.  We must not look at whats best for parents but the total educational system.

It has been reported by Principal of Aggie and Administrative Assistant Yolander Dixon to Superintedent Tower that the expected closurer date of its School District and High School is slated for July 2017.  According to Senator Gray Tollison this is a move of the entire State Of Mississippi Legislative Body of Senators and Representives.

NA,NA,"THE LETTER FROM & LIST OF COALITION OF ""89""  U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell is leading a bipartisan coalition of 89 representatives in asking the U.S. Treasury Department to reject a Central States Pension Fund request to cut retiree benefits.  _______________________________   Dear Special Master Feinberg,  We write today on behalf of the thousands of retirees and the families we represent in strong opposition to the reduction in benefits proposed by the Board of Trustees of the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan (Central States Pension Plan) (CSPF), which has submitted an application to the Treasury Department to reduce benefits under the CSPF in accordance with the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 (MPRA).  The proposed cuts by Central States will affect about 270,000 people with a significant number of those retirees facing severe cuts of 50-70 percent. Pension benefits are hard earned by workers over a lifetime of labor and commitment. These cuts will have a dire impact not on only individual workers and retirees, but their entire communities as well. In addition, we have serious concerns that government safety net programs will increasingly be the only option left for families who will face a drastic reduction in their purchasing power.  We do not believe placing an inordinate burden on middle-class workers and retirees is the only option for Central States. For these reasons and more, we urge the Treasury Department to deny this application and move forward with a more equitable solution.  Thank you for your consideration of our views on this important matter. Please do not hesitate to contact us if we may be of assistance.  Sincerely, THE""89""  ___________________________________  Alma Adams (D-NC); Brad Ashford (D-NE); Karen Bass (D-CA); Joyce Beatty (D-OH); Sanford Bishop (D-GA); Suzanne Bonamici (D-OR); Robert A.

"10215389293629452","Diana Alf St","Federal Anti-Horse-Slaughter bills S. 1214 and H.R. 1942 are strongly supported by horse racing industries. Leading breeders, owners, and enthusiasts are arguing for a ban on horse slaughter to save horse racing from the decline the industry is currently experiencing.  All of the large race tracks across the USA, including Churchill Downs and Keeneland, have enacted stringent anti-slaughter policies imposing penalties, including race bans, to anyone caught selling a horse to slaughter or to kill-buyers via auctions.  Is it now time for the US Congress (you) to help save the horse racing industry by banning all slaughter, and transport to slaughter, of American Horses. Per a Jockey Club funded report published in 2011, Americans are turning away from the racetracks due to cruelty concerns, foremost the concern of race horses ending up in the slaughter pipeline.   As you know by now the brutality of horse slaughter has been well documented by USDA inspectors in the USA, and by EU inspectors in both Mexican and Canadian plants.  Please help bolster and save the industry of horse racing in the USA by shutting down inherently cruel horse slaughter and transport to horse slaughter. Do it for the horses, for the sport of racing, and for the decency of humanity. Please Cosponsor and Pass Bills S. 1214 and H.R. 1942.","2016-02-08T22:07:28+0000",0,0,"10153470657168380_10153482460088380","7259193379_10153470657168380",FALSE,NA

If you can convince her to publicly acknowledge my concerns, I'll make a $2,700 donation to a mutually agreed upon Mississippi charity and a matching contribution to her campaign. She doesn't even have to attempt an answer. Just raise the issue.  Every NFL stadium has 50,000 - 100,000 active wireless devices capable of receiving real-time, false information. Shouldn't the NFL explicitly warn its fans that legitimate emergency evacuation orders would NEVER be delivered via their personal cell phones?

Hint: official evac orders come from the public address system in tandem with the video monitors.

"10155477264630804","Dee Ann Roseberry","POLITICIANS PAID OFF BY MONSANTO  Democrat, Republican, it doesn’t matter. As long as you can help Monsanto slide  its icy tentacles into the food chain, then there’s some financial tip available to you.   Thankfully, many such ties can be exposed through some data digging, and thanks to diligent readers who send comprehensive news tips and their researchers out there, we now have an extensive list of politicians getting paid cold hard cash from GMO juggernaut ... Monsanto.   Keep in mind these are the figures we know, which means that behind the scenes expect these numbers to multiply extensively. But what is most amazing is that these politicians just don’t care that you know they’re receiving thousands of dollars from Monsanto! They sweep it under the carpet, but they are openly taking money from this corporation that has been caught running ‘slave-like’ rings and disregarding public health. We’re talking about a corporation that primarily aided in the creation of Agent Orange — the Vietnam-era chemical weapon that killed over 400,000 people and led to 500,000 plus birth defects.   Over $374,000 was openly pumped into the House and Senate. And again, this is openly. I’m speculating, but I would imagine the real number to easily be in the millions. Can you imagine how much they must pay these politicians to shoot down GMO labeling bills that 90 plus percent of the entire country wants?   Monsanto paid Senator Roy Blunt to ‘help write’ the Monsanto Protection Act that grants Monsanto immunity from federal courts? Roy’s cash payment is not included in this list, however RT reports he received $64,250 towards his campaign from the company. Surely they expected nothing in return.

"10209037480489070","Mary Ellen Hall","To members of Congress regarding Post 911 GI Bill issues. During the month of May, it was my privilege to correspond with various members of Congress regarding Post 911 GI Bill benefits.  I was overwhelmed with the courtesy and suggestions offered by those with whom I made contact.  At this time, I am corresponding with all members of Congress to enlist their help in possibly amending the transfer benefit available under the Post 911 GI Bill. The purpose of my correspondence was to address the issue of transfer of benefits to dependents of Veterans qualifying for the Post 911 GI Bill.  When the bill was passed in 2009, it allowed transfer of  benefits by eligible veterans to a dependent.  The transfer benefit was utilized to retain active duty personnel who would agree to serve additional specified lengths of service in order to transfer the Post 911 GI Bill benefits .    In discussion with members of Congress and their staff, I was able to identify possible need for recognizing eligible Post 911 GI Bill veterans unable to serve additional lengths of time to facilitate transfer of their benefits. The guidelines for eligibility identify veterans as well as the transfer of benefits option.  However, some of those eligible veterans retired with 20+ years of service as well as a service related disability of 25% or more.  This would preclude them from transferring the benefits to a dependent .    These veterans are in a group possibly having difficulty paying for a dependents college attendance   due to limited retirement income.   My sincere desire is that many of you will co sponsor a bill amending the transferability of the Post 911 GI Bill.  A proposed amendment could read as follows…  A veteran eligible to receive the post 911 GI Bill, having served over 20 years and retired with a disability rating of 25% of greater,  may  transfer benefits to a dependent. As a 78 year old Grandma fighting 2 types of cancer and the costs involved, this is the only way I feel able to help my son in law, daughter and grandson with college expenses.  Any consideration you could give of this matter would be appreciated.  (And the time involved in corresponding with all of you has certainly kept me off the streets….so thanks for your help and for listening.)

The Central Ms CoC has reassigned our operating grants to another agency.  We were the lead agency for HMIS, PLANNING, SSVF AND THE ESG grants for Hinds county and the surrounding 5 counties.  We have never had a finding or citation!  This move was mad because of Louis Armstrong, chair of CoC and convicted felon, and Donetta McAdoo, director of the local field office, egos and lack of concern for the community they are suppose to serve.  We have contacted HUD Washington, to no avail.  This community will lose $500,000.00 in funds for homeless veterans and underprivileged women and children.   For any information regarding our previously offered services, please contact City of Jackson – Dept. of Planning and Development; Mississippi Home Corporation (MHC), or Veterans Administration – Housing Assistance.

NA,NA,"I am a non-affiliated independent voter who is blocking all Democrats until they admit and repent for funding bloody violence against opposition groups and at protests, for their conduct against Sanders, for Super Delegate super leads, and for working with media to feed Hillary debate questions at debates. I am an independent because both political parties have been slow cooking their policies to block everyday Americans from participating in the election process for President.  DNC Superdelegates is a Soviet Style apparatchik-type approach to ensure that only the Party Elites have a chance to be the party nominee.  On the Republican side we noted, for the first time in history, in the Soviet State of Colorado that not a single Republican registered voter was allowed to cast a vote for that party's nominee for President.  Additionally, the Soviet Republican Party of Colorado also did not even allow for Republican voters to even participate in a caucus to choose their state's nominee for President.  In the Soviet State of Colorado it was Party Elites who decided the Presidential nominee/delegates. These are the reasons why Americans no longer trust our government political leaders. This is exactly why an outsider like Trump received so much support across the country. As far as ObamaCare goes, the Communists in the Democratic Party did not have enough commies to back their Single Payer take over of the entire Medical Industry.  Instead they passed ObamaCare based on lies because they knew that it would collapse and that hopefully in 2017, that they could finally raise Single Payer out of the ashes of ObamaCare under Hillary Clinton.  When socialists, communists, and democrats understand the formula PRICE=SUPPLY/QUALITY + DEMAND maybe an intelligent debate can be had regarding the affordability of any goods or services delivered through a socialist program. No generation should borrow trillions and leave that massive debt to future generations. Our federal government is a disgrace and largely a failure across the board for every department and agency.   MLK would be ashamed of the Democratic Party today.  He wanted a color blind society where skin pigmentation did not matter, yet Democrats continue to divide Americans for power and votes. At least Alveda King sees through your nonsense.","2017-01-18T17:36:20+0000",1,0,"10154262251613380_10154361517943380","7259193379_10154262251613380",FALSE,NA
